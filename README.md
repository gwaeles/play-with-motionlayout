Motion Layout Sample
============

My goal is just to play with Motion Layout features. It should allow us to make cool effects in easy way. I realised a circle menu component with sequential expand effect.

* [scene_menu.xml](/app/src/main/res/xml/scene_menu.xml) : One last xml file for customing transition (timing, sequencing, effects, ...).

Environment & Libraries

My opinion
--------------

Motion Layout is a very simple way to create cool animations. You create the start and end states with direct rendering in the Android Studio Design tool. This is much more accessible than the animation class manipulations around the "animate" method. However, it can take a long time to tweak advanced effects. One could possibly criticize the multiplication of xml files strongly dependent. Finally, I found that Motion Layout does not require much effort and this exercise makes me want to use it in my projects.
